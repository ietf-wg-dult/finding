The attestation mechanism described in Section [TODO] is intended to mitigate this attack.\r\n\r\nCan we specifically state with this draft that non compliant trackers be locked out from being able to utilize the crowd sourced FindMy networks? We can't stop more sophisticated trackers, but we can at least stop them from being able to use this network. \r\n\r\nForgive me if this is addressed somewhere else.\r\n",

      "body": "The current draft provides a solid framework for detecting and locating tracking accessories. I have identified a few security and privacy risks that adversaries could exploit. This issue outlines these risks and proposes cryptographic and architectural enhancements to mitigate them.\n\n**Identified Security and Privacy Gaps & Proposed Enhancements**:\n\n1. **Malicious Crowdsourced Network (CN) or Insider Threats**\n\n    - **Risk**:\n      - The Crowdsourced Network (CN) has visibility into Owner Device (OD) queries and Finder Device (FD) reports.\n      - A compromised CN could correlate multiple queries for the same ephemeral public key (`Y_i`), potentially tracking an OD\u2019s requests over time.\n      - If CN can link an OD to an accessory (ACC), it could expose a user\u2019s movement patterns.\n    - **Proposed Enhancements**:\n      - **Blinding Queries from OD to CN**: Use Private Information Retrieval (PIR) to ensure CN cannot see which `Y_i` the OD is querying. Alternatively, use Oblivious Pseudorandom Functions (OPRFs) to prevent CN from learning specific queries.\n      - **Decouple FD Reports from CN Processing**: \n        - Introduce an **anonymization layer** (e.g., onion routing or mixnets) before reports reach CN.\n        - Implement **Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC)** to prevent CN from linking FD-reported locations to specific accessories.\n\n2. **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks on the Network**\n    - **Risk**:\n      - A malicious actor could flood CN with **fake accessory reports** or excessive location lookups, causing congestion and disrupting tracking.\n      - Attackers could launch a Sybil attack by creating many fake FDs to manipulate location reports.\n    - **Proposed Enhancements**:\n      - **Rate Limiting & Proof-of-Work (PoW)**\n        - **Require PoW for FD reports**, making large-scale spam attacks costly.\n        - **Implement attestation for FDs** to verify legitimate devices before allowing reports.\n      - **Zero-Knowledge Rate Limiting**\n        - Use zk-SNARKs or blind signatures to limit queries per OD without exposing identity.\n        - Example: Allow `N` queries per hour, enforced cryptographically, without CN knowing which OD made them.\n\n3. **Linkability Across Time Intervals**\n    - **Risk**:\n      - Despite ephemeral public keys (Y_i), an attacker monitoring multiple BLE advertisements can correlate movements over time.\n      - Linkage attacks can be performed by clustering similar movement patterns of different Y_i values.\n    - **Proposed Enhancements**:\n      - **More Frequent Key Rotation & Non-Deterministic Derivation**\n        - Instead of using a deterministic formula like:\n        `Yi = H(SecretKey\u2223\u2223epoch)`\n        Use random perturbation in key derivation:\n        `Yi = H(SecretKey\u2223\u2223epoch\u2223\u2223r)`\n        where `r` is a cryptographically secure random value per interval (and `H` is a cryptographic hash function).\n      - **Dummy Broadcasts to Break Correlation**: Accessories should emit fake tracking signals at random intervals to break adversarial tracking.\n\n4. **Evasion Techniques by Malicious Accessories**\n    - **Risk**:\n      - Attackers may modify accessories to:\n        - Evade detection by rapidly changing IDs beyond the allowed rotation window.\n        - Bypass rate limits by distributing fake accessories across multiple locations.\n    - **Proposed Enhancements**:\n      - **Attestation Mechanism for Accessories**: Require accessories to cryptographically prove compliance with key rotation policies.\n      - **Crowdsourced Anomaly Detection**: Train an ML-based detection model to identify irregular accessory behavior.\n\n5. **Reporting Device (FD) Anonymity**\n    - **Risk**:\n      - Even with OHTTP/MASQUE, Finder Devices (FDs) may still be linkable over time if they consistently report tracking events to the same central server.\n      - An adversary observing multiple reports from the same FD could correlate its behavior, fingerprint the device, and potentially infer movement patterns.\n      - Persistent FD identifiers in reports could allow long-term tracking of specific devices, even if their IP addresses are anonymized.\n    - **Proposed Enhancements**:\n      - **Obfuscating FD Identifiers in Reports**: Use rotating **pseudonymous identities** for Finder Devices instead of persistent device identifiers. This prevents long-term tracking of the same FD by the central server or third parties.\n      - **Location Perturbation for Differential Privacy**: Add randomized noise to location reports, preventing precise tracking while maintaining usefulness.\n\n   ",

A malicious or compromised CN could correlate multiple queries for the same ephemeral public key (Y_i) and potentially track an OD\u2019s requests over time.\n2. **Linkage of OD to Accessories**: If the CN can link an OD to a specific accessory (ACC), it could expose user movement patterns and compromise privacy.\n\n**Proposed Enhancements:**\n\n1. **Blinding Queries from OD to CN**:\n    - **Approach**: Utilize techniques such as Private Information Retrieval (PIR) to ensure that the CN cannot determine which ephemeral public key (Y_i) an OD is querying.\n    - **Alternate Option**: Implement Oblivious Pseudorandom Functions (OPRFs) so that CN does not learn any specific details about the queries.\n\n2. **Decoupling FD Reports from CN Processing**:\n    - **Anonymization Layer**: Introduce an anonymization layer (e.g., onion routing or mixnets) so that FD reports are obscured before reaching the CN.\n    - **Secure Computation**: Employ Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) to prevent the CN from linking reported locations directly to specific accessories.\n\n\n**Note**: This is the Split 1 of https://github.com/ietf-wg-dult/finding/issues/13",
